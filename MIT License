## ✅ 2. How to Push to GitHub (Step-by-Step)

If you haven't used Git before, here’s a **basic guide using GitHub’s web interface**:

### 📦 Option A: Upload via GitHub Website

1. Go to https://github.com and **create a new repository**
   - Name: `conflict-style-adventure`
   - Description: _(optional)_
   - Public or private — your choice

2. After creating the repo:
   - Click **“Add file” > “Upload files”**
   - Upload:
     - `conflict_adventure.py`
     - `requirements.txt`
     - `README.md` (the one above)

3. Click **“Commit changes”**.

Done! ✅ Now you’re ready to [deploy it on Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

### 🤝 Want Me to Package It?

If you'd prefer, I can generate a **ZIP file** with everything ready-to-upload (Python file, README, requirements.txt). Just say:

> “Yes, send me the ZIP package.”

Or let me know if you're using Git locally and want the CLI commands instead.
